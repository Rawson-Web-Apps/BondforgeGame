    "content": "\r\n## Personal Background\r\n\r\nI've played Persona 3 Reload, Persona 5 Royal, and Shin Megami Tensei V. While Shin Megami Tensei did not stand out to me in particular, the Persona series is one of my favorites in video games. I was extremely exited to play Metaphor ReFantazio and consider myself an expert at the mechanics of the Persona series.\r\n\r\n#### Music: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Metaphor ReFantazio is nothing short of remarkable, perfectly complementing the tone of the game. While it took some time for the priest's singing to resonate with me, it eventually became an integral part of the experience, encapsulating the game's religious themes with finesse. The in-world acknowledgment of the music, where the protagonist can also hear the tracks, added a unique and immersive layer to the storytelling. Moreover, the battle themes excelled at creating a sense of tension and urgency during combat—a crucial element in turn-based gameplay. These compositions heightened the stakes and made each decision in battle feel impactful.\r\n\r\n#### Gameplay: 10/10\r\n\r\nMetaphor ReFantazio’s gameplay strikes a perfect balance between strategic depth and engaging mechanics. The calendar system, reminiscent of Persona, is implemented masterfully, ensuring that every decision feels meaningful. Players must plan their days carefully, weighing the consequences of each action. This layer of time management adds a compelling sense of agency and responsibility to the gameplay loop, making every choice matter.\r\n\r\n#### Combat: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe combat system in Metaphor ReFantazio is a stellar fusion of the best elements from Shin Megami Tensei and Persona. It provides a robust and rewarding experience, with the archetype system standing out as a highlight. Exploring and leveling various archetypes significantly impacts the strength and versatility of each character's final archetype, ensuring that grinding and skill mastery feel rewarding. The strategic depth and progression mechanics kept battles exciting and satisfying throughout.\r\n\r\n#### Story: 10/10\r\n\r\nMetaphor ReFantazio delivers a story that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. Its narrative masterfully weaves real-world struggles and philosophical concepts into a rich and fantastical setting. The themes and character arcs are profoundly impactful, inviting reflection and emotional engagement. It’s a story that resonates deeply, elevating the game to a work of art.\r\n\r\n#### Art: 10/10\r\n\r\nVisually, Metaphor ReFantazio is breathtaking. Its art style is both unique and captivating, blending intricate designs with a fantastical charm that perfectly suits the game’s tone. Every environment, character, and animation is crafted with care, resulting in a world that feels alive and enchanting. It’s a visual masterpiece that stands as one of the game’s strongest aspects.\r\n\r\n#### Performance: 7/10\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the game’s performance leaves room for improvement. While it ran, the experience was marred by inconsistent frame rates and occasional stuttering on my PC. These issues, though not game-breaking, were noticeable enough to detract slightly from the overall experience. A more polished performance would have allowed the game’s brilliance to shine even brighter.\r\n\r\n#### Overall: 10/10\r\n\r\nMetaphor ReFantazio is a masterpiece that sets a new standard for the genre. Its outstanding music, engaging gameplay, innovative combat, compelling story, and stunning art make it an unforgettable experience. Despite minor performance issues, it’s a game I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone seeking a deeply impactful and beautifully crafted RPG.\r\n"

    "content": "\r\n## Personal Background\r\n\r\nI have never played any of the Dragon Quest series before, but I have heard\r\nmany good things about them. I was excited to try this one out. As a huge fan\r\nof old school RPGs, like the early Final Fantasy games, this was a great\r\nintroduction to the series. Given that I have not played the original Dragon\r\nQuest III, I can't make any comparisons between the two so please keep that in\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n\r\n#### Mechanics: 9/10\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the ability to change classes at level 20. It allowed me to\r\nexperiment with different playstyles and find what worked best for me. The\r\nconstant leveling up and gaining of new abilities kept the game feeling fresh.\r\nIn addition, the constant leveling up meant that I could stay in dungeons for\r\nlonger periods of time before needing to heal up.\r\n\r\nThe battle system was simple and easy to understand. I never had any trouble\r\nfiguring out what was happening in battle. The battle system itself was fun and\r\nchallenging. I died many times, but it never felt cheap or unfair. I always felt\r\nlike I had a good chance of beating a battle if I was properly prepared. Like\r\nany old school JRPG, being prepared typically meant having to spend a lot of\r\ntime grinding levels. I think DQIII HD-2D Remake just falls short because of\r\nthe lack of new mechanics towards higher levels.\r\n\r\n#### Difficulty: 8/10\r\n\r\nThe game does a good job of balancing the difficulty of battles. Most of the\r\ntime I was properly prepared for battles, but there were a few times where I\r\nwas not. The last few bosses were brutal especially when compared to the earlier\r\nones. The ammount of griding required to progress felt somewhat excessive at times.\r\nOr to get around the excessive grinding, battles would take so long with constant\r\nheals that I would start to get bored.\r\n\r\n#### Pacing: 7/10\r\n\r\nThe game does a good job at pacing the story for most of the game. Towards the\r\nend game, I found myself spending far more time preparing for battles tough\r\nbattles through mind numbing grinding than doing what felt like rewarding\r\ncontent. Since this is often the nature of old school RPGs, it is not\r\nunreasonable to expect this.\r\n\r\n## Story and Characters\r\n\r\n#### Narrative: 7/10\r\n\r\nThe story was interesting but really lacked any sort of emotional impact. I\r\nfound myself not caring about the characters or the story as a whole. As this\r\nwas not the main focus of the game, I don't think this detracts from the game\r\ntoo much.\r\n\r\n#### Character Development: 7/10\r\n\r\nThe characters were fine, but there was not much character development.\r\n\r\n#### World Building: 9/10\r\n\r\nThe world building was good. I liked how each area felt unique and played a\r\npart in the overall story.\r\n\r\n## Grapchs and Art Style\r\n\r\n#### Visual Quality: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe art style was great. I loved the old school feel of it blended with the\r\nHD remastered graphics. Throughout the game I was constantly impressed and\r\nfound myself hoping for more games to be remade in this style.\r\n\r\n#### Art Direction: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe art in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is fantastic. I am a huge fan of the\r\nstyle and would often zone out while playing to take in the scenery.\r\n\r\n## Sound and Music\r\n\r\n#### Sound Design: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe sound effects were great. They fit the tone of the game perfectly and\r\nadded a lot to the overall experience. I imagine they weren't too different from\r\nthe original other than being remastered but they were still great.\r\n\r\n#### Music: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe music was great. I loved the old school feel of it and it fit the tone of\r\nthe game perfectly. This was likely the most compelling part of the game and was\r\nwhat brought me back each time to play.\r\n\r\n## Replayability and Longevity\r\n\r\n#### Content: 7/10\r\n\r\nI think the $60 launch price is a fair ask. There is easily 30 hours of content\r\nfor a single playthrough. With the amount of customizing and side quests available,\r\nI imagine the play time could be much higher. For any skeptics of turn based games\r\nor old school JRPGs, I would recommend waiting for a sale before picking this\r\nup.\r\n\r\n#### Replay Value: 8/10\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to customize your experience in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.\r\nWith so many party compositions and the ability to adjust classes relatively easily,\r\nI could see some vary interesting combinations. In addition to multiple game difficulty\r\nsettings, there is a decent amount of content that can be different for a new playthrough.\r\nThat said, the lack of a new game plus mode might make a new playthrough feel less\r\nrewarding than other titles.\r\n\r\n## Innovation and Originality\r\n\r\n#### Creativity: 9/10\r\n\r\nIt is hard for me to give a fair assessment of creativity given that I have not\r\nplayed the original Dragon Quest III. That said, the combat mechanics were similar\r\nto other old school JRPGs but still manage to stand on their own. I was happy to\r\nspend the time that I did mastering the mechanics and finding the best party\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\n#### Risk-Taking: 9/10\r\n\r\nI think allowing players to reclass at level 20 was a great risk. It added a lot\r\nof replayability to the game and forced players to think about their party\r\ncompositions. It also forced players to be mindful of their current party levels\r\nand not go into dungeons unprepared.\r\n\r\n### Overal Enjoyment\r\n\r\n#### Stability and Optimization: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe game ran flawlessly on my PC. I did not experience any crashes or bugs.\r\n\r\n#### Engagement: 10/10\r\n\r\nThis game was very engaging. I couldn't put it down and wanted to keep playing.\r\nThe constant leveling up and new abilities kept me wanting to see what was next.\r\n\r\n#### Emotional Impact: 7/10\r\n\r\nI thought the music was filled with vigor and life. It fit the tone of the game\r\nperfectly and made me want to keep playing. There were occasional story beats that\r\nhad an impact, but I would stay overal it was underwhelming.\r\n"
