    "content": "\r\n## Personal Background\r\n\r\nAs a long-time fan of both the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy series, I came into Final Fantasy VII Rebirth with exceptionally high expectations. I have played Final Fantasy titles like FF1, FF2, FF4, FF7, Crisis Core, FF10, FF14, FF15, and FF16, so my love for this franchise runs deep. On a personal note, Cloud Strife’s name, which symbolizes \"cloudy vision,\" resonates with me due to my own experience with cataract surgery. This connection gave Rebirth a uniquely personal significance for me. I can confidently say that this game not only met my expectations but exceeded them in every way.\r\n\r\n#### Music: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe Rebirth soundtrack is an absolute triumph. With a staggering number of tracks to fit a variety of moods and settings, it stands as one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever created. The remastered versions of iconic tracks, like the Golden Saucer theme, were a delight to hear, while original compositions like No Promises to Keep added fresh, memorable moments to the game. The music of Final Fantasy VII has always been iconic, and Rebirth continues that legacy with finesse. I will be listening to this soundtrack for years to come.\r\n\r\n#### Gameplay: 10/10\r\n\r\nRebirth offers an incredible amount of content and gives players the freedom to engage with it in the order they prefer. While some reviewers found the abundance of content overwhelming, I took a more flexible approach, saving less urgent tasks for my New Game Plus run. This freedom allowed me to always focus on activities I found enjoyable, whether it was mastering mini-games, leveling up my characters, hunting down challenging monsters, testing my combat skills in arenas, or diving deeper into the story. There was never a dull moment, and the game’s design always kept me fully immersed.\r\n\r\n#### Combat: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe combat system in Rebirth is nothing short of spectacular. While the combat in Remake took me some time to fully grasp, Rebirth builds on its strengths and introduces new mechanics that elevate the experience. From the outset, the aerial combat mechanics add a dynamic layer to battles, while the synergy system stands out as one of the best-designed mechanics I’ve ever encountered in a game. The game’s focus on bonds is reflected in the combat, encouraging players to strategize and leverage synergy moves effectively. A personal highlight was how Cloud’s inability to counter magic damage without using a synergy skill underscored the importance of teamwork over individual prowess. The combat in Rebirth truly exemplifies the power of collaboration.\r\n\r\n#### Story: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe story of Rebirth had me utterly captivated from beginning to end. The developers have been clear about their intention to keep even returning fans of FF7 guessing, and they succeeded brilliantly. While remaining faithful to the original, Rebirth manages to introduce enough surprises to keep longtime fans on the edge of their seats. Seeing iconic moments brought to life with stunning Unreal Engine 4 graphics was a deeply emotional experience. The cast’s performances were outstanding, breathing life into each character in a way that few games achieve. This is storytelling at its finest.\r\n\r\n#### Overall: 10/10\r\n\r\nFinal Fantasy VII Rebirth is now my favorite game of all time. Every element of the game captivated me, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of my playthrough. To put things in perspective, I earned the platinum trophy on March 15, 2024, just over two weeks after its release on February 29, 2024. Considering it required over 100 hours of gameplay, you can imagine how much time I devoted to it each day. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a triumph in every sense of the word. Its music, gameplay, combat, and story all come together to create an unforgettable experience. It’s a game that will resonate with me for years and one I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who loves RPGs, Final Fantasy, or simply great games.\r\n"

    "content": "\r\n## Personal Background\r\n\r\nI've played Persona 3 Reload, Persona 5 Royal, and Shin Megami Tensei V. While Shin Megami Tensei did not stand out to me in particular, the Persona series is one of my favorites in video games. I was extremely exited to play Metaphor ReFantazio and consider myself an expert at the mechanics of the Persona series.\r\n\r\n#### Music: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Metaphor ReFantazio is nothing short of remarkable, perfectly complementing the tone of the game. While it took some time for the priest's singing to resonate with me, it eventually became an integral part of the experience, encapsulating the game's religious themes with finesse. The in-world acknowledgment of the music, where the protagonist can also hear the tracks, added a unique and immersive layer to the storytelling. Moreover, the battle themes excelled at creating a sense of tension and urgency during combat—a crucial element in turn-based gameplay. These compositions heightened the stakes and made each decision in battle feel impactful.\r\n\r\n#### Gameplay: 10/10\r\n\r\nMetaphor ReFantazio’s gameplay strikes a perfect balance between strategic depth and engaging mechanics. The calendar system, reminiscent of Persona, is implemented masterfully, ensuring that every decision feels meaningful. Players must plan their days carefully, weighing the consequences of each action. This layer of time management adds a compelling sense of agency and responsibility to the gameplay loop, making every choice matter.\r\n\r\n#### Combat: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe combat system in Metaphor ReFantazio is a stellar fusion of the best elements from Shin Megami Tensei and Persona. It provides a robust and rewarding experience, with the archetype system standing out as a highlight. Exploring and leveling various archetypes significantly impacts the strength and versatility of each character's final archetype, ensuring that grinding and skill mastery feel rewarding. The strategic depth and progression mechanics kept battles exciting and satisfying throughout.\r\n\r\n#### Story: 10/10\r\n\r\nMetaphor ReFantazio delivers a story that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. Its narrative masterfully weaves real-world struggles and philosophical concepts into a rich and fantastical setting. The themes and character arcs are profoundly impactful, inviting reflection and emotional engagement. It’s a story that resonates deeply, elevating the game to a work of art.\r\n\r\n#### Art: 10/10\r\n\r\nVisually, Metaphor ReFantazio is breathtaking. Its art style is both unique and captivating, blending intricate designs with a fantastical charm that perfectly suits the game’s tone. Every environment, character, and animation is crafted with care, resulting in a world that feels alive and enchanting. It’s a visual masterpiece that stands as one of the game’s strongest aspects.\r\n\r\n#### Performance: 7/10\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the game’s performance leaves room for improvement. While it ran, the experience was marred by inconsistent frame rates and occasional stuttering on my PC. These issues, though not game-breaking, were noticeable enough to detract slightly from the overall experience. A more polished performance would have allowed the game’s brilliance to shine even brighter.\r\n\r\n#### Overall: 10/10\r\n\r\nMetaphor ReFantazio is a masterpiece that sets a new standard for the genre. Its outstanding music, engaging gameplay, innovative combat, compelling story, and stunning art make it an unforgettable experience. Despite minor performance issues, it’s a game I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone seeking a deeply impactful and beautifully crafted RPG.\r\n"

    "content": "\r\n## Personal Background\r\n\r\nIn recent years, I discovered the Persona series and have become a passionate fan. I have extensively played both Persona 5 Royal and Persona 3 Reload, and I consider myself an expert in the base mechanics of the series. With my deep love for the base game, I went into Episode Aigis: The Answer with very high expectations, and it did not disappoint.\r\n\r\n#### Music: 10/10\r\n\r\nPersona music has always been a highlight of the series, and the soundtrack for Episode Aigis is no exception. The tracks beautifully capture the themes and setting of the game, adding depth to every moment. As soon as I finished the DLC, I was thrilled to find the soundtrack available on Apple Music, and it has since been a staple of my playlist. The music is simply phenomenal and continues the Persona tradition of delivering unforgettable compositions.\r\n\r\n#### Gameplay: 10/10\r\n\r\nEpisode Aigis shifts its focus to combat, setting aside the calendar system from the base game. For a DLC, this was a welcome change. I appreciated how the characters reset to relatively low levels despite the usual level 99 cap, as it allowed me to fully engage with the releveling process and master the new gameplay mechanics. Aigis’s ability to change Personas added versatility, but her default weapon—a gun—required me to adapt my strategies from the base game.\r\n\r\nThe Persona system was also well-implemented, allowing players to summon Personas from the base game’s compendium for a cost. This balanced the need to diligently collect new Personas while providing the freedom to revisit old favorites. Additionally, I enjoyed experimenting with the synergy between Aigis and the new character, Metis. Their dynamic added a fresh layer to the gameplay that kept battles exciting.\r\n\r\n#### Combat: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe combat in Episode Aigis stays true to the Persona series, offering the challenge and depth fans have come to expect. I struggled significantly with the DLC’s secret boss, but that difficulty felt fair and rewarding. The releveling process, combined with the balanced difficulty curve, made every encounter engaging. Combat enthusiasts will find a lot to love here.\r\n\r\n#### Story: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe story of Episode Aigis resonated deeply with me. Like the base game’s narrative, it is poignant and thought-provoking. It was gratifying to see how the rest of the party processed the events of the base game’s conclusion. Both stories frequently come to mind, and I find myself reflecting on their themes long after the credits rolled. Experiencing these narratives has been a truly enriching experience.\r\n\r\n#### Overall: 10/10\r\n\r\nPersona 3 Reload Episode Aigis: The Answer is a phenomenal addition to an already outstanding game. Every aspect—from the music and gameplay to the combat and story—is executed to perfection. Atlus has delivered an incredible year in 2024, with Persona 3 Reload, Episode Aigis, and Metaphor ReFantazio all earning perfect scores from me. I’m eagerly anticipating what Atlus has in store next, as they continue to set the bar for the RPG genre.\r\n"

    "title": "Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake",
    "release_date": "2024-11-14",
    "platform": "PC",
    "score": 9,
    "content": "\r\n## Personal Background\r\n\r\nI have never played any of the Dragon Quest series before, but I have heard\r\nmany good things about them. I was excited to try this one out. As a huge fan\r\nof old school RPGs, like the early Final Fantasy games, this was a great\r\nintroduction to the series. Given that I have not played the original Dragon\r\nQuest III, I can't make any comparisons between the two so please keep that in\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n## Gameplay\r\n\r\n#### Mechanics: 9/10\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the ability to change classes at level 20. It allowed me to\r\nexperiment with different playstyles and find what worked best for me. The\r\nconstant leveling up and gaining of new abilities kept the game feeling fresh.\r\nIn addition, the constant leveling up meant that I could stay in dungeons for\r\nlonger periods of time before needing to heal up.\r\n\r\nThe battle system was simple and easy to understand. I never had any trouble\r\nfiguring out what was happening in battle. The battle system itself was fun and\r\nchallenging. I died many times, but it never felt cheap or unfair. I always felt\r\nlike I had a good chance of beating a battle if I was properly prepared. Like\r\nany old school JRPG, being prepared typically meant having to spend a lot of\r\ntime grinding levels. I think DQIII HD-2D Remake just falls short because of\r\nthe lack of new mechanics towards higher levels.\r\n\r\n#### Difficulty: 8/10\r\n\r\nThe game does a good job of balancing the difficulty of battles. Most of the\r\ntime I was properly prepared for battles, but there were a few times where I\r\nwas not. The last few bosses were brutal especially when compared to the earlier\r\nones. The ammount of griding required to progress felt somewhat excessive at times.\r\nOr to get around the excessive grinding, battles would take so long with constant\r\nheals that I would start to get bored.\r\n\r\n#### Pacing: 7/10\r\n\r\nThe game does a good job at pacing the story for most of the game. Towards the\r\nend game, I found myself spending far more time preparing for battles tough\r\nbattles through mind numbing grinding than doing what felt like rewarding\r\ncontent. Since this is often the nature of old school RPGs, it is not\r\nunreasonable to expect this.\r\n\r\n## Story and Characters\r\n\r\n#### Narrative: 7/10\r\n\r\nThe story was interesting but really lacked any sort of emotional impact. I\r\nfound myself not caring about the characters or the story as a whole. As this\r\nwas not the main focus of the game, I don't think this detracts from the game\r\ntoo much.\r\n\r\n#### Character Development: 7/10\r\n\r\nThe characters were fine, but there was not much character development.\r\n\r\n#### World Building: 9/10\r\n\r\nThe world building was good. I liked how each area felt unique and played a\r\npart in the overall story.\r\n\r\n## Grapchs and Art Style\r\n\r\n#### Visual Quality: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe art style was great. I loved the old school feel of it blended with the\r\nHD remastered graphics. Throughout the game I was constantly impressed and\r\nfound myself hoping for more games to be remade in this style.\r\n\r\n#### Art Direction: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe art in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is fantastic. I am a huge fan of the\r\nstyle and would often zone out while playing to take in the scenery.\r\n\r\n## Sound and Music\r\n\r\n#### Sound Design: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe sound effects were great. They fit the tone of the game perfectly and\r\nadded a lot to the overall experience. I imagine they weren't too different from\r\nthe original other than being remastered but they were still great.\r\n\r\n#### Music: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe music was great. I loved the old school feel of it and it fit the tone of\r\nthe game perfectly. This was likely the most compelling part of the game and was\r\nwhat brought me back each time to play.\r\n\r\n## Replayability and Longevity\r\n\r\n#### Content: 7/10\r\n\r\nI think the $60 launch price is a fair ask. There is easily 30 hours of content\r\nfor a single playthrough. With the amount of customizing and side quests available,\r\nI imagine the play time could be much higher. For any skeptics of turn based games\r\nor old school JRPGs, I would recommend waiting for a sale before picking this\r\nup.\r\n\r\n#### Replay Value: 8/10\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to customize your experience in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.\r\nWith so many party compositions and the ability to adjust classes relatively easily,\r\nI could see some vary interesting combinations. In addition to multiple game difficulty\r\nsettings, there is a decent amount of content that can be different for a new playthrough.\r\nThat said, the lack of a new game plus mode might make a new playthrough feel less\r\nrewarding than other titles.\r\n\r\n## Innovation and Originality\r\n\r\n#### Creativity: 9/10\r\n\r\nIt is hard for me to give a fair assessment of creativity given that I have not\r\nplayed the original Dragon Quest III. That said, the combat mechanics were similar\r\nto other old school JRPGs but still manage to stand on their own. I was happy to\r\nspend the time that I did mastering the mechanics and finding the best party\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\n#### Risk-Taking: 9/10\r\n\r\nI think allowing players to reclass at level 20 was a great risk. It added a lot\r\nof replayability to the game and forced players to think about their party\r\ncompositions. It also forced players to be mindful of their current party levels\r\nand not go into dungeons unprepared.\r\n\r\n### Overal Enjoyment\r\n\r\n#### Stability and Optimization: 10/10\r\n\r\nThe game ran flawlessly on my PC. I did not experience any crashes or bugs.\r\n\r\n#### Engagement: 10/10\r\n\r\nThis game was very engaging. I couldn't put it down and wanted to keep playing.\r\nThe constant leveling up and new abilities kept me wanting to see what was next.\r\n\r\n#### Emotional Impact: 7/10\r\n\r\nI thought the music was filled with vigor and life. It fit the tone of the game\r\nperfectly and made me want to keep playing. There were occasional story beats that\r\nhad an impact, but I would stay overal it was underwhelming.\r\n"

    "platform": "PC",
    "score": 8.5,
    "content": "\r\n## Personal Background\r\n\r\nI’ve always been a huge fan of old-school JRPGs, but Romancing Saga 2: Revenge of the Seven marks my first entry in the Romancing Saga series. I was initially drawn to the game after seeing advertisements highlighting its unique inheritance mechanic, which piqued my curiosity and set my expectations high.\r\n\r\n#### Music: 8/10\r\n\r\nThe music in Romancing Saga 2 does an excellent job of setting the tone and atmosphere. Each track fits the game’s world beautifully, enhancing the experience and immersing players in its setting. However, none of the tracks stood out as particularly memorable or ones I would listen to outside of the game. While the soundtrack is solid, it doesn’t reach the iconic heights of some other JRPG scores.\r\n\r\n#### Gameplay: 9/10\r\n\r\nThe inheritance mechanics are where this game truly shines. Passing down knowledge and skills to the next generation felt immensely rewarding and added a unique layer to the gameplay. It’s a concept I haven’t seen executed quite like this in any other title. That said, it created an interesting dynamic with party members—I often found myself letting teammates die in order to recruit stronger replacements. While this detracted from the sense of teamwork and survival I typically enjoy in party-based games, the overall gameplay experience remained highly enjoyable.\r\n\r\n#### Combat: 9/10\r\n\r\nThe combat in Romancing Saga 2 introduces some refreshing changes compared to traditional old-school JRPGs. The formation system adds a tactical layer, allowing players to experiment with positioning and strategies. The variety of classes offered clear, distinct roles in combat, and I thoroughly enjoyed the trial-and-error process of finding the most effective strategies. I also appreciated how the game incorporates mistakes and death as natural parts of its mechanics, encouraging players to learn and adapt.\r\n\r\n#### Story: 8/10\r\n\r\nThe story was, unfortunately, one of the game’s weaker elements for me. I found it difficult to remain engaged and often skipped through dialogue to return to the gameplay and combat that I enjoyed so much. While the narrative wasn’t bad, it lacked the depth and emotional resonance I’ve come to expect from other games in the genre.\r\n\r\n#### Overall: 8.5/10\r\n\r\nDespite a somewhat lackluster story, Romancing Saga 2: Revenge of the Seven delivers an incredibly rewarding and enjoyable gameplay experience. The inheritance mechanics, tactical combat, and rich class system kept me hooked throughout my playthrough. I’m glad to see a New Game Plus mode, and I’m looking forward to revisiting the game in the future. It’s a must-play for fans of unique mechanics and classic JRPG gameplay.\r\n"
