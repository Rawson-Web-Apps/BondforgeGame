## Personal Background

I have never played any of the Dragon Quest series before, but I have heard
many good things about them. I was excited to try this one out. As a huge fan
of old school RPGs, like the early Final Fantasy games, this was a great
introduction to the series. Given that I have not played the original Dragon
Quest III, I can't make any comparisons between the two so please keep that in
mind.

## Gameplay

#### Mechanics: 9/10

I really enjoyed the ability to change classes at level 20. It allowed me to
experiment with different playstyles and find what worked best for me. The
constant leveling up and gaining of new abilities kept the game feeling fresh.
In addition, the constant leveling up meant that I could stay in dungeons for
longer periods of time before needing to heal up.

The battle system was simple and easy to understand. I never had any trouble
figuring out what was happening in battle. The battle system itself was fun and
challenging. I died many times, but it never felt cheap or unfair. I always felt
like I had a good chance of beating a battle if I was properly prepared. Like
any old school JRPG, being prepared typically meant having to spend a lot of
time grinding levels. I think DQIII HD-2D Remake just falls short because of
the lack of new mechanics towards higher levels.

#### Difficulty: 8/10

The game does a good job of balancing the difficulty of battles. Most of the
time I was properly prepared for battles, but there were a few times where I
was not. The last few bosses were brutal especially when compared to the earlier
ones. The ammount of griding required to progress felt somewhat excessive at times.
Or to get around the excessive grinding, battles would take so long with constant
heals that I would start to get bored.

#### Pacing: 7/10

The game does a good job at pacing the story for most of the game. Towards the
end game, I found myself spending far more time preparing for battles tough
battles through mind numbing grinding than doing what felt like rewarding
content. Since this is often the nature of old school RPGs, it is not
unreasonable to expect this.

## Story and Characters

#### Narrative: 7/10

The story was interesting but really lacked any sort of emotional impact. I
found myself not caring about the characters or the story as a whole. As this
was not the main focus of the game, I don't think this detracts from the game
too much.

#### Character Development: 7/10

The characters were fine, but there was not much character development.

#### World Building: 9/10

The world building was good. I liked how each area felt unique and played a
part in the overall story.

## Grapchs and Art Style

#### Visual Quality: 10/10

The art style was great. I loved the old school feel of it blended with the
HD remastered graphics. Throughout the game I was constantly impressed and
found myself hoping for more games to be remade in this style.

#### Art Direction: 10/10

The art in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is fantastic. I am a huge fan of the
style and would often zone out while playing to take in the scenery.

## Sound and Music

#### Sound Design: 10/10

The sound effects were great. They fit the tone of the game perfectly and
added a lot to the overall experience. I imagine they weren't too different from
the original other than being remastered but they were still great.

#### Music: 10/10

The music was great. I loved the old school feel of it and it fit the tone of
the game perfectly. This was likely the most compelling part of the game and was
what brought me back each time to play.

## Replayability and Longevity

#### Content: 7/10

I think the $60 launch price is a fair ask. There is easily 30 hours of content
for a single playthrough. With the amount of customizing and side quests available,
I imagine the play time could be much higher. For any skeptics of turn based games
or old school JRPGs, I would recommend waiting for a sale before picking this
up.

#### Replay Value: 8/10

There are many ways to customize your experience in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.
With so many party compositions and the ability to adjust classes relatively easily,
I could see some vary interesting combinations. In addition to multiple game difficulty
settings, there is a decent amount of content that can be different for a new playthrough.
That said, the lack of a new game plus mode might make a new playthrough feel less
rewarding than other titles.

## Innovation and Originality

#### Creativity: 9/10

It is hard for me to give a fair assessment of creativity given that I have not
played the original Dragon Quest III. That said, the combat mechanics were similar
to other old school JRPGs but still manage to stand on their own. I was happy to
spend the time that I did mastering the mechanics and finding the best party
compositions.

#### Risk-Taking: 9/10

I think allowing players to reclass at level 20 was a great risk. It added a lot
of replayability to the game and forced players to think about their party
compositions. It also forced players to be mindful of their current party levels
and not go into dungeons unprepared.

### Overal Enjoyment

#### Stability and Optimization: 10/10

The game ran flawlessly on my PC. I did not experience any crashes or bugs.

#### Engagement: 10/10

This game was very engaging. I couldn't put it down and wanted to keep playing.
The constant leveling up and new abilities kept me wanting to see what was next.

#### Emotional Impact: 7/10

I thought the music was filled with vigor and life. It fit the tone of the game
perfectly and made me want to keep playing. There were occasional story beats that
had an impact, but I would stay overal it was underwhelming.
