## Personal Background

I grew up playing the Budokai Tenkaichi games and was thrilled to see the series return with Dragon Ball Sparking Zero. My memories of countless hours playing Budokai Tenkaichi with family and friends added an extra layer of excitement for this release. It’s been a nostalgic trip down memory lane while exploring what the new game has to offer.

#### Graphics: 9/10

The updated visuals are impressive. Powered by Unreal Engine, the game features stunning effects that breathe life into the Dragon Ball universe. However, performance on my machine in 4K wasn’t ideal. More graphics options, such as DLSS and FSR, would be a welcome addition for a demanding game like this. Even so, the game looks fantastic overall, and the visual fidelity is a major highlight.

#### Combat: 9/10

The combat feels like a faithful evolution of Tenkaichi 3, and I was able to pick it up easily as a series veteran. While the difficulty in story mode can be steep initially, it’s manageable once you get the hang of it. The core mechanics deliver the fast-paced, high-energy battles fans of the series love.

#### Multiplayer: 7/10

I’ve reached A Rank in multiplayer, primarily playing as Gogeta Super Saiyan 4, and my experience has been mixed. While I enjoyed some truly fun matchups and encountered minimal connectivity issues, the balance can feel off. In several matches, it seemed like I won despite my opponent’s clear superiority, thanks to unbalanced mechanics. The competitive potential of the game remains uncertain, though casual online matches can still be enjoyable.

#### Story: 8/10

The story mode feels somewhat lackluster compared to other Dragon Ball games. However, the sheer variety of characters and the focus on combat-driven storytelling are definite strengths. The static pictures with dialogue didn’t bother me much, especially since I skipped most of the scenes anyway. Staying true to the Tenkaichi format was a solid choice, even if this mode wasn’t my main focus.

#### Gameplay: 8/10

As a long-time fan, I found the game’s mechanics easy to pick up. That said, newcomers might find the menus and item options overly complex, detracting from the simplicity of an arena fighter. While seeing characters like Goku and friends in the menus adds charm, a more streamlined and user-friendly interface would improve the experience significantly.

#### Music: 8/10

The music matches the Dragon Ball vibe perfectly, enhancing the game’s high-energy atmosphere. However, none of the tracks stood out as particularly memorable. While the soundtrack does its job well, it doesn’t leave a lasting impression.

#### Overall: 8/10

Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is a fantastic return to the beloved franchise and a must-play for any Dragon Ball fan. While competitive players may find its balance lacking, it’s tailored more as a party experience and excels in delivering nostalgic fun. For those who grew up with the Budokai Tenkaichi series, this game is a worthy successor that’s sure to provide hours of enjoyment.
