## Personal Background

Some of my oldest and fondest memories are tied to the Legend of Zelda series. My family has been playing these games for as long as I can remember, and I’ve played every non-handheld title dating back to Ocarina of Time. Zelda is, without question, one of my all-time favorite franchises, and I eagerly dove into Tears of the Kingdom with high expectations.

#### Music: 9/10

The music in Tears of the Kingdom is a significant step up from Breath of the Wild, in my opinion. While the relaxed and minimalist themes of BOTW had their charm, I appreciated the added variety in Tears. Boss music and sinister tracks did an excellent job of setting the tone for a Hyrule under siege, and callbacks to classics like Zelda’s Lullaby were a delightful touch. Zelda music rarely disappoints, and this entry continues that tradition.

#### Gameplay: 10/10

Tears of the Kingdom had the monumental task of living up to and surpassing Breath of the Wild, and it did so with ease. Quality-of-life improvements, such as the ability to drop equipment directly from a chest menu, streamlined the experience. Exploration was continually rewarding, with the addition of the Depths and Sky Islands layering on top of an already impressive overworld. Even the altered overworld from BOTW felt fresh and exciting.

The new Zonai mechanics replacing the Sheikah Slate were a highlight. While it took time to adjust to tools like Ultrahand and Ascend, these mechanics ensured the shrines and puzzles felt innovative and distinct. I was constantly amazed at how much content and complexity was packed into a Nintendo Switch game, and the design choices kept the gameplay feeling fresh throughout.

#### Combat: 9/10

Combat remains largely similar to BOTW, with the notable addition of the Fuse mechanic. Fuse added a creative and entertaining layer to the system, allowing for a wide variety of weapon combinations. The improved enemy variety compared to BOTW was also a major plus. The difficulty curve felt satisfying—I saw the Game Over screen more times than I’d like to admit! While the combat is excellent, I do hope for more innovation in this area for future titles.

#### Story: 9/10

The story’s flexibility in allowing players to piece events together on their own timeline was both a strength and a potential drawback. While I enjoyed this approach and didn’t experience much confusion, I can see how obtaining story pieces out of order might frustrate some players. That said, I was thrilled to see Ganondorf more fleshed out as a character, and the game’s conclusion was deeply satisfying. It’s a story that will stay with me for a long time.

#### Overall: 10/10

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a masterpiece and a definitive title for the Nintendo Switch. From its breathtaking exploration and innovative mechanics to its compelling story and music, it’s a game that exceeds expectations at every turn. I couldn’t put it down until the credits rolled and would highly recommend it to Zelda fans, Switch owners, and open-world enthusiasts alike. Tears of the Kingdom cements its place as one of the greatest games of this generation, and I can’t wait to see what’s next from Nintendo.
