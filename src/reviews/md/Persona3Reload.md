## Personal Background

Going into Persona 3 Reload, I had extensive experience with Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal. Having played Royal multiple times and earning the platinum trophy on PlayStation, I was comfortable with the mechanics of the series and excited to see what Persona 3 Reload had to offer. Since I hadn’t played any version of Persona 3 before, this experience was completely fresh for me.

#### Music: 10/10

The soundtrack for Persona 3 Reload is absolutely phenomenal. From the moment I finished the game, I started exploring the soundtracks of previous Persona 3 versions and was thrilled when the Reload soundtrack became available on Apple Music. The music perfectly matches the game’s themes, creating a uniquely immersive experience that ranks among my favorite soundtracks of all time. Certain tracks have become staples in my daily playlist, which speaks to their lasting impact.

#### Gameplay: 10/10

Persona 3 Reload stays true to the Persona formula, which, from what I’ve learned, originated with this game. While not every social link resonated with me, the system as a whole was rewarding, and I pushed to max out as many links as possible. The calendar system reinforces the weight of your choices, keeping the gameplay engaging. Although the loop becomes more apparent in the latter half, it helped me focus on decisions that would best serve my goals.

The persona fusion system felt rewarding, allowing for strategic planning that carried over to combat. Building multiple effective setups for my playthrough was immensely satisfying. Exploring Tartarus, the massive labyrinth filled with shadows, was initially enjoyable thanks to its procedurally generated floors. However, the seemingly endless ascent grew tiresome over time. That said, I appreciated the challenge rooms in the Monad Doors, which offered beefier shadows to test my party’s strength.

I also loved the return of Shuffle Time over shadow negotiation. The bonuses from Shuffle Time provided meaningful rewards beyond new personas, and the mechanic’s integration with All-Out Attacks added extra strategic depth. This encouraged me to use All-Out Attacks even when quicker alternatives were available, enriching the gameplay loop.

#### Combat: 10/10

The combat system in Persona 3 Reload introduces slight differences from Persona 5 Royal, such as an additional physical type and the absence of psychic and nuclear types. I enjoyed the three distinct physical damage types and how weapon choice determined a party member’s type. This added a layer of planning that influenced my favorite builds and encouraged me to use characters I might not have otherwise.

The social link bonuses during combat were another highlight, showcasing how strong bonds translate into gameplay. This integration of story and combat feels authentic and adds emotional weight to battles. The Theurgy System was a fantastic addition, giving each party member unique mechanics for charging their gauges while reinforcing their personalities. The protagonist’s ability to unlock new Theurgy abilities through persona fusion further incentivized completing the persona compendium. The game’s difficulty struck a perfect balance, requiring enough training to feel accomplished without becoming frustrating.

#### Story: 10/10

The story of Persona 3 Reload is profound and thought-provoking. Its themes and core message continue to resonate with me, and I often find myself reflecting on its principles. The cast of party members is exceptional, with each character brought to life through outstanding voice performances. The narrative’s emotional weight makes it one of the most memorable stories I’ve experienced in gaming.

#### Overall: 10/10

Persona 3 Reload is a masterpiece that refreshes a genre-defining classic. Its combination of compelling music, rewarding gameplay, immersive combat, and a deeply resonant story makes it one of my favorite games of all time. It’s a must-play for JRPG fans, and I eagerly await the day I can justify another playthrough. This is Persona at its finest.
