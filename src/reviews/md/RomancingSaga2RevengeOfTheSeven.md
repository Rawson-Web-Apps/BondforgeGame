## Personal Background

I’ve always been a huge fan of old-school JRPGs, but Romancing Saga 2: Revenge of the Seven marks my first entry in the Romancing Saga series. I was initially drawn to the game after seeing advertisements highlighting its unique inheritance mechanic, which piqued my curiosity and set my expectations high.

#### Music: 8/10

The music in Romancing Saga 2 does an excellent job of setting the tone and atmosphere. Each track fits the game’s world beautifully, enhancing the experience and immersing players in its setting. However, none of the tracks stood out as particularly memorable or ones I would listen to outside of the game. While the soundtrack is solid, it doesn’t reach the iconic heights of some other JRPG scores.

#### Gameplay: 9/10

The inheritance mechanics are where this game truly shines. Passing down knowledge and skills to the next generation felt immensely rewarding and added a unique layer to the gameplay. It’s a concept I haven’t seen executed quite like this in any other title. That said, it created an interesting dynamic with party members—I often found myself letting teammates die in order to recruit stronger replacements. While this detracted from the sense of teamwork and survival I typically enjoy in party-based games, the overall gameplay experience remained highly enjoyable.

#### Combat: 9/10

The combat in Romancing Saga 2 introduces some refreshing changes compared to traditional old-school JRPGs. The formation system adds a tactical layer, allowing players to experiment with positioning and strategies. The variety of classes offered clear, distinct roles in combat, and I thoroughly enjoyed the trial-and-error process of finding the most effective strategies. I also appreciated how the game incorporates mistakes and death as natural parts of its mechanics, encouraging players to learn and adapt.

#### Story: 8/10

The story was, unfortunately, one of the game’s weaker elements for me. I found it difficult to remain engaged and often skipped through dialogue to return to the gameplay and combat that I enjoyed so much. While the narrative wasn’t bad, it lacked the depth and emotional resonance I’ve come to expect from other games in the genre.

#### Overall: 8.5/10

Despite a somewhat lackluster story, Romancing Saga 2: Revenge of the Seven delivers an incredibly rewarding and enjoyable gameplay experience. The inheritance mechanics, tactical combat, and rich class system kept me hooked throughout my playthrough. I’m glad to see a New Game Plus mode, and I’m looking forward to revisiting the game in the future. It’s a must-play for fans of unique mechanics and classic JRPG gameplay.
