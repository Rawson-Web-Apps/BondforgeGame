## Personal Background

As a long-time fan of both the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy series, I came into Final Fantasy VII Rebirth with exceptionally high expectations. I have played Final Fantasy titles like FF1, FF2, FF4, FF7, Crisis Core, FF10, FF14, FF15, and FF16, so my love for this franchise runs deep. On a personal note, Cloud Strife’s name, which symbolizes "cloudy vision," resonates with me due to my own experience with cataract surgery. This connection gave Rebirth a uniquely personal significance for me. I can confidently say that this game not only met my expectations but exceeded them in every way.

#### Music: 10/10

The Rebirth soundtrack is an absolute triumph. With a staggering number of tracks to fit a variety of moods and settings, it stands as one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever created. The remastered versions of iconic tracks, like the Golden Saucer theme, were a delight to hear, while original compositions like No Promises to Keep added fresh, memorable moments to the game. The music of Final Fantasy VII has always been iconic, and Rebirth continues that legacy with finesse. I will be listening to this soundtrack for years to come.

#### Gameplay: 10/10

Rebirth offers an incredible amount of content and gives players the freedom to engage with it in the order they prefer. While some reviewers found the abundance of content overwhelming, I took a more flexible approach, saving less urgent tasks for my New Game Plus run. This freedom allowed me to always focus on activities I found enjoyable, whether it was mastering mini-games, leveling up my characters, hunting down challenging monsters, testing my combat skills in arenas, or diving deeper into the story. There was never a dull moment, and the game’s design always kept me fully immersed.

#### Combat: 10/10

The combat system in Rebirth is nothing short of spectacular. While the combat in Remake took me some time to fully grasp, Rebirth builds on its strengths and introduces new mechanics that elevate the experience. From the outset, the aerial combat mechanics add a dynamic layer to battles, while the synergy system stands out as one of the best-designed mechanics I’ve ever encountered in a game. The game’s focus on bonds is reflected in the combat, encouraging players to strategize and leverage synergy moves effectively. A personal highlight was how Cloud’s inability to counter magic damage without using a synergy skill underscored the importance of teamwork over individual prowess. The combat in Rebirth truly exemplifies the power of collaboration.

#### Story: 10/10

The story of Rebirth had me utterly captivated from beginning to end. The developers have been clear about their intention to keep even returning fans of FF7 guessing, and they succeeded brilliantly. While remaining faithful to the original, Rebirth manages to introduce enough surprises to keep longtime fans on the edge of their seats. Seeing iconic moments brought to life with stunning Unreal Engine 4 graphics was a deeply emotional experience. The cast’s performances were outstanding, breathing life into each character in a way that few games achieve. This is storytelling at its finest.

#### Overall: 10/10

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now my favorite game of all time. Every element of the game captivated me, and I thoroughly enjoyed every second of my playthrough. To put things in perspective, I earned the platinum trophy on March 15, 2024, just over two weeks after its release on February 29, 2024. Considering it required over 100 hours of gameplay, you can imagine how much time I devoted to it each day. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a triumph in every sense of the word. Its music, gameplay, combat, and story all come together to create an unforgettable experience. It’s a game that will resonate with me for years and one I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who loves RPGs, Final Fantasy, or simply great games.
