## Personal Background

I've played Persona 3 Reload, Persona 5 Royal, and Shin Megami Tensei V. While Shin Megami Tensei did not stand out to me in particular, the Persona series is one of my favorites in video games. I was extremely exited to play Metaphor ReFantazio and consider myself an expert at the mechanics of the Persona series.

#### Music: 10/10

The soundtrack of Metaphor ReFantazio is nothing short of remarkable, perfectly complementing the tone of the game. While it took some time for the priest's singing to resonate with me, it eventually became an integral part of the experience, encapsulating the game's religious themes with finesse. The in-world acknowledgment of the music, where the protagonist can also hear the tracks, added a unique and immersive layer to the storytelling. Moreover, the battle themes excelled at creating a sense of tension and urgency during combat—a crucial element in turn-based gameplay. These compositions heightened the stakes and made each decision in battle feel impactful.

#### Gameplay: 10/10

Metaphor ReFantazio’s gameplay strikes a perfect balance between strategic depth and engaging mechanics. The calendar system, reminiscent of Persona, is implemented masterfully, ensuring that every decision feels meaningful. Players must plan their days carefully, weighing the consequences of each action. This layer of time management adds a compelling sense of agency and responsibility to the gameplay loop, making every choice matter.

#### Combat: 10/10

The combat system in Metaphor ReFantazio is a stellar fusion of the best elements from Shin Megami Tensei and Persona. It provides a robust and rewarding experience, with the archetype system standing out as a highlight. Exploring and leveling various archetypes significantly impacts the strength and versatility of each character's final archetype, ensuring that grinding and skill mastery feel rewarding. The strategic depth and progression mechanics kept battles exciting and satisfying throughout.

#### Story: 10/10

Metaphor ReFantazio delivers a story that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. Its narrative masterfully weaves real-world struggles and philosophical concepts into a rich and fantastical setting. The themes and character arcs are profoundly impactful, inviting reflection and emotional engagement. It’s a story that resonates deeply, elevating the game to a work of art.

#### Art: 10/10

Visually, Metaphor ReFantazio is breathtaking. Its art style is both unique and captivating, blending intricate designs with a fantastical charm that perfectly suits the game’s tone. Every environment, character, and animation is crafted with care, resulting in a world that feels alive and enchanting. It’s a visual masterpiece that stands as one of the game’s strongest aspects.

#### Performance: 7/10

Unfortunately, the game’s performance leaves room for improvement. While it ran, the experience was marred by inconsistent frame rates and occasional stuttering on my PC. These issues, though not game-breaking, were noticeable enough to detract slightly from the overall experience. A more polished performance would have allowed the game’s brilliance to shine even brighter.

#### Overall: 10/10

Metaphor ReFantazio is a masterpiece that sets a new standard for the genre. Its outstanding music, engaging gameplay, innovative combat, compelling story, and stunning art make it an unforgettable experience. Despite minor performance issues, it’s a game I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone seeking a deeply impactful and beautifully crafted RPG.
