## Personal Background

In recent years, I discovered the Persona series and have become a passionate fan. I have extensively played both Persona 5 Royal and Persona 3 Reload, and I consider myself an expert in the base mechanics of the series. With my deep love for the base game, I went into Episode Aigis: The Answer with very high expectations, and it did not disappoint.

#### Music: 10/10

Persona music has always been a highlight of the series, and the soundtrack for Episode Aigis is no exception. The tracks beautifully capture the themes and setting of the game, adding depth to every moment. As soon as I finished the DLC, I was thrilled to find the soundtrack available on Apple Music, and it has since been a staple of my playlist. The music is simply phenomenal and continues the Persona tradition of delivering unforgettable compositions.

#### Gameplay: 10/10

Episode Aigis shifts its focus to combat, setting aside the calendar system from the base game. For a DLC, this was a welcome change. I appreciated how the characters reset to relatively low levels despite the usual level 99 cap, as it allowed me to fully engage with the releveling process and master the new gameplay mechanics. Aigis’s ability to change Personas added versatility, but her default weapon—a gun—required me to adapt my strategies from the base game.

The Persona system was also well-implemented, allowing players to summon Personas from the base game’s compendium for a cost. This balanced the need to diligently collect new Personas while providing the freedom to revisit old favorites. Additionally, I enjoyed experimenting with the synergy between Aigis and the new character, Metis. Their dynamic added a fresh layer to the gameplay that kept battles exciting.

#### Combat: 10/10

The combat in Episode Aigis stays true to the Persona series, offering the challenge and depth fans have come to expect. I struggled significantly with the DLC’s secret boss, but that difficulty felt fair and rewarding. The releveling process, combined with the balanced difficulty curve, made every encounter engaging. Combat enthusiasts will find a lot to love here.

#### Story: 10/10

The story of Episode Aigis resonated deeply with me. Like the base game’s narrative, it is poignant and thought-provoking. It was gratifying to see how the rest of the party processed the events of the base game’s conclusion. Both stories frequently come to mind, and I find myself reflecting on their themes long after the credits rolled. Experiencing these narratives has been a truly enriching experience.

#### Overall: 10/10

Persona 3 Reload Episode Aigis: The Answer is a phenomenal addition to an already outstanding game. Every aspect—from the music and gameplay to the combat and story—is executed to perfection. Atlus has delivered an incredible year in 2024, with Persona 3 Reload, Episode Aigis, and Metaphor ReFantazio all earning perfect scores from me. I’m eagerly anticipating what Atlus has in store next, as they continue to set the bar for the RPG genre.
